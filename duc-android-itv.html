In my UK home I have FireTVs, not perfect, too much amazon push, but workable. For the FireTV platform (still android) I have iPlayer, ITV hub, 4oD, Demand 5, TVPlayer. Sure I have to sideload some of these but they are all big screen remote friendly. Why is it amazon can cultivate these android devs and AndroidTV cant ?? Does amazon splash the cash more ? iPlayer is a really big missing factor for me. I really think the AndroidTV platform could be superior, its more of a framework. Hi Guys, I have a Sony android TV and I live in Japan. All I want to do is install BBC iPlayer, Channel 4, Channel 5 and ITV on my TV. Do these apps exist for Android TV? How do I get them and install them? I have a VPN on the TV which I use to watch Netflix. The google store app doesn't seem to work when I have my VPN on though, I initially thought if I accessed the google store with the vpn on I could download the apps, but to no avail. Ive been looking around and is it true there I've got the new nvidia shield and while it is great I've noticed the number is available isn't great. What are some apps which can be sideloaded that work really. 
I am in Canada, so I won't be getting it by default with the new 6.1 update, so I would appreciate it if someone could upload the new ITV app and post it here. Thanks. I have both. I use the Nexus Player on another TV. Is it possible to extract these apps to use on a Nexus Player, and if so how would I go about. Just posting the response update to the email I sent to ITV Box Office, regarding those who was hoping to use ps4 like me to watch the event: Hi Reece, Thanks for your email. Unfortunately, AEW: Double or Nothing will no longer be available to purchase on PS4. It's due to a technical issue in taking this feed so it means they are unable to broadcast the event like they have done with our previous pay-per-view events. Double or Nothing is available to purchase via Sky, Virgin and TVPla. Warning. Great Wall Of Text ahead. So you've decided to head across the Pond to London for the two game series at the end of June. You're an absolute legend, following your team across an ocean, and we should have a suitcase statue in Monument Park for dedicated people like your good self. The only problem is, you don't know what you're going to do with yourself. Maybe you already have a game ticket, maybe you're hoping to snag one outside the stadium in the Stratford area of London, maybe. If you can't wait for Pie update to arrive in your country or you are tired with checking for OTA all the time you can just sideload the update manually. I will describe here how to do it. amp#x200B; Firstly, check your CSC. You can do it in Settings gt About phone gt Software information gt Service provider SW ver. You are interested in values marked red on the picture: https://i.imgur.com/ixJmU5j.jpg (https://i.imgur.com/ixJmU5j.jpg) If the marked value in the first line says "OXM". If your android is having battery issues and you use Webroot, try uninstalling it. Webroot is having some issues after a recent update. My wife and I each had phone problems all weekend that went away after deleting the offending software. We each use Moto G4 phones. amp#x200B; https://community.webroot.com/webroot-mobile-security-for-android-15/webroot-mobile-security-and-antivirus-android-app-update-battery-usage-issue-338055/index5.html?fbclid=IwAR2e4DQuHlsn3JJXT2alUzdAjITvSkW1M0HSa012g. 
Just posting the update, response to the email I sent regarding the event not been available on ps4 anymore, for those hoping to watch through ps4 like me: Hi Reece, Thanks for your email. Unfortunately, AEW: Double or Nothing will no longer be available to purchase on PS4. It's due to a technical issue in taking this feed so it means they are unable to broadcast the event like they have done with our previous pay-per-view events. Double or Nothing is available to purchase Hi, amp#x200B; I am from the Middle East and I used three paid VPN services NordVPN (Active), PureVPN (Cancelled) and PrivateVPN. In addition, I have VPS servers in US, UK, and NL VPS I host on them OpenVPN server to use them as VPN beside the other services I hosted on them. amp#x200B; I did not intend to subscribe to PrivateVPN, but due to the 7 days trial offer I give it a shot and I received the registration link from the support and I began my 7 days trial. amp#x200B;. So I just got a MiBox to replace my FireStick and was sad to see that the Play Store has an extremely limited selection of apps I tried using apks like Aurora to install apps like UKTV Play, ITV Hub, 4OD and Five On Demand but they're really clunky to use and at times don't work at all.so I was wondering if there was a way to transfer the apks from FireStick to AndroidTV Or better yet, a way to install the full Fire TV app store onto the Mi Box so that I can keep them updated and install.
