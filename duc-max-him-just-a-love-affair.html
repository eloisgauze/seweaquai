                            <p> It's ridiculous to think the only books on magical theory in magic school will be half-assed scribbled notes of other wizards, otherwise known as spellbooks. There are dozens of books there. Some on more mundane subjects, like math or philosophy, some are just boring primers or encyclopedias on various topics a wizard-to-be should know. And some,while not classic spellbooks, may contain spell as example, or be of use to adventurer in other ways. amp#x200B; D100 Textbook Benefits of reading/. Jung Sung Il is probably South Korea's most prominent film critic, and his contributions laid grounds for the cinephile culture of the whole country. /u/struttinwithsomebbq posted Jung's 29 films of the 21st Century, and while we're at it, I thought it would be nice to introduce another list by him. ampnbsp; "A Guide to Cinephilia" is a piece of writing posted on Korean Film Archive's web magazine in 2016, written by Jung. It consists of an introductory note, recommendations I'm one of those people who LOVE season 2. Like, I was invested since episode 1. And there's one simple reason why: Sean and Daniel. No shit, you say. But hear me out. amp#x200B; So the story starts with Dan and Sean being your typical brothers: Sean hates when Dan snoops around his room, yet he's super concerned when he sees Dan playing outside and he quickly goes check on him, only to find himself in a situation he'd never expect. Long story short, they end up having to run away. Okay, “objectively” isn’t really the best word to use here, since the choices in these games are inherently subjective, but I’ll be using that word throughout this anyway for lack of a better word. Anyway, here’s what I’m trying to accomplish: I want to try to determine which choices the player would have to choose to make the most cohesive narrative throughout the series – not the version of the story I personally enjoy the most or I personally think is the best, but the version of the story. A person asked me to make a list of clues and foreshadow that I think could indicate that Jon amp Sansa will happen (as a romantic relationship). So I decided to make a post as well. I see a lot of anti-Jonsa posts but never a post explaining why some people think that this couple is possible. If you are not interested in my post, go your way. It's useless to waste your time criticizing. By cons, if you are interested, curious, want to give me your opinion and talk, good reading! Good evening all, Throwaway account here. Tonight I 23,F got into an argument with my mother and it got pretty bad to the point my boyfriend wants me to move in with him. Let me share some backstory for you all. My boyfriend 25,M and I have been together for a year and I’m extremely close with his family and they’ve done nothing but welcome me in with open arms and treat me wonderfully. They’re truly the family I wish I had growing up as I never had siblings and wasn’t super close Sorry, second post in one week. This hiatus is killing me! Are they going to do a daughter trade? Okay, stop rolling your eyes. Stay with me. I had a shower moment. So, I’ve been noodling over the Elián González/Holly theory for S3 for a while (kudos to those who first thought of it) but couldn’t quite imagine Canada compelling Holly to be returned to Gilead based on human rights issues alone. (Having said that, González was returned to Cuba despite drummed up accusations of human.

Eliza’s log, which I posted last time, really unsettled me. Again, I couldn’t say for sure at that point whether this was all fiction or really happened, but I’ll tell you that it felt real, especially when I thought Hello, everyone!! bathrobeDFS is here with your Daily MLB Analysis. First, I will go over any weather concerns. Then, we will take a look at the Vegas lines. Next, I will take a look at Pitchers. Then I will look at the Hitters.

copied and pasted from my tumblr post again: as promised here are my notes on the season 2 scripts i read, still with the heavy Nick bias. if you missed it, you can see my season 1 post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHandmaidsTale/comments/auc61o/spoilers_s1e10_i_read_the_scripts_and_im_setting/)! btw i did not write up the scenes that are already in the “script to screen” clips - like the ambulance scene, etc - since you can already see those for yourself. uhh the writers get spicy. Just because your adventurers are trudging through a wilderness miles away from a settlement worth its salt doesn’t mean you can’t break up the trip with an opportunity to spend some coin and engage in some uncomplicated mercantile roleplay. Of course, your party could also gather intelligence, find these intrepid or unlucky traders suspicious or an easy mark.

I’ve been a lurker here the past four months and perhaps this sub can help me now as well. Buckle up for a long one (sorry) - I need to get things sorted. tldr at the end. So, first some background: I M36 am married (lasting 10 years now) and we have two kids (ages 1 and 5). Short version is that my current life consists of kids and work, both of whom I love, but intimacy with wife is limited to max once a week. Still. Until four months ago, I though. Phew , this one was hard to write, but I hope you all enjoy it! Fair warning, it gets a little graphic, but not enough to be marked NSFW.

I took a look at this years schedule and wrote up a bit about how I feel about each of our opponents week by week. I'm not predicting scores or outcomes, just musing over what each match-up gets me thinking about.
